Welcome to the JobScraPy package repo. This package is a work-in-progress, I hope you enjoy it nonetheless.  Please visit the GitHub Pages site -->

When using automated web tools, please remember to be respectful of the sites you visit and conserve your computing resources as well as theirs.  Different sites may also have policies that prohibit scraping altogether.

P.S. There are several distinct projects by different authors using variations of the name JobScraPy. This one just happens to be mine. Nothing new under the sun, as they say.
