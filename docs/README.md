Welcome to the JobScraPy documentation site, hosted by Github Pages. This site is a work-in-progress, I hope you enjoy it nonetheless.

To-do:
* Add documentation for core functions here
* Add docstrings to the functions to make them more user-friendly
* Optimize for an official release
* Fix name?

**15-06-2024 Note: A new name may need to be selected as a result of an existing unrelated tool also called jobscrapy developed a few years ago by Zack Adlington (also posted on GitHub).  I thought my naming pun may have been original, but "nothing new under the sun" holds true unfortunately.**
