Each website's career board has a certain layout for postings, including pages, scrolling, ID numbers, and other details.  In order to streamline the process of extracting relevant details, the distinct page elements and necessary regex searchstrings have been encased in the form of a dictionary object.  Presently, the populate() function is limited to a small selection of pre-built dicts, but this can be further improved and optimized in the future or by cloning and modifying the code.
