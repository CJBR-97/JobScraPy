### Career Board Dictionaries

Each website's career board has a certain layout for postings, including pages, scrolling, ID numbers, and other details.  In order to streamline the process of extracting relevant details, the distinct page elements and necessary regex searchstrings have been encased in the form of a dictionary object.  

The custom_company function currently performs this function (documentation pending).
